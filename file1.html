        A Russian court on Thursday sentenced the American basketball star Brittney Griner to nine years in a penal colony after convicting her on a drug charge, a harsh penalty that keeps her fate entwined with the geopolitical showdown over the war in Ukraine
        and ramps up already intense pressure on President Biden to win her release
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        The U.S. government contends that she is among several Americans who have been “wrongfully detained” by Russia, used as bargaining chips in the increasingly hostile relationship between Moscow and Washington. The Biden administration has offered a prisoner
        swap involving Ms. Griner, but Russian officials said it was premature to discuss a deal while her case was underway.

    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Now that the trial is concluded, Mr. Biden faces a difficult choice between standing firm on his proposal to trade for Ms. Griner and another American, Paul N. Whelan, or sweetening the offer somehow, with either position liable to draw domestic criticism.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        The Kremlin, for its part, can use them as leverage, with no incentive to resolve the cases quickly. Her supporters, voicing horror at the verdict and sentence, are clamoring for the president to do something, while the administration is wary of giving
        in to Russian tactics it has all but labeled as blackmail.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        “My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,” Mr. Biden said in a statement after the verdict.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Ms. Griner, 31, one of her sport’s biggest global stars, sat mostly expressionless, eyes downcast, leaning her long frame toward the bars of the defendant’s box in a cramped courtroom outside Moscow to hear as the words of the judge, Anna S. Sotnikova,
        were quietly translated for her. She had already pleaded guilty and conviction is all but certain in Russian courts, so the verdict was a foregone conclusion; the real question was about sentencing. The answer was devastating.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Brittney Griner has been sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony for possessing a tiny amount of cannabis oil. Griner’s case was never about a minor offense against Russia law (which was real, for what that’s worth). It’s about what kind of
        country Russia has become as its president, Vladimir Putin, has descended into anti-Western hysteria while initiating foreign wars and ramping up internal repression.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Griner was arrested just days before the invasion of Ukraine, which is to say that she was grabbed after Putin and his circle had almost certainly made the decision to go to war. She was perfect for the part that the Russians wanted her to play as a possible
        bargaining chip. She is a prominent American, but not too prominent. She is gay, Black, and covered in tattoos, the kind of defendant for whom the average Russian will have no sympathy. Detaining her for a minor drug charge must have been an easy
        call for the Russian intelligence services.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Better yet for the Kremlin, the American determination to get her back home serves a Russian-propaganda purpose. Russia does not value all its citizens equally; some Russians matter and others vanish without trace. The efforts to spring Griner, however,
        almost certainly feed into a Russian narrative that America, too, does not care about all of its citizens equally and that we value racial or sexual minorities disproportionately—exactly the case that anti-Western hysterics like Putin have been
        making for years. Look at the effort the Americans put into getting this person back, the Russians will say later. That’s who they care about.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        The fact that the U.S. has been trying for years to obtain the release of Paul Whelan—a middle-aged white male who has been languishing in a Russian prison for four years on trumped-up espionage charges—will count as nothing, because Whelan’s case never
        generated the kind of publicity that surrounded Griner’s arrest.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        The Russians, for their part, are angling to get a Russian national named Viktor Bout traded for Griner and Whelan. (Griner’s harsh sentence is unrelated to the seriousness of her crime; rather, it is a signal from Russia that we must somehow reach a
        deal with them or she will vanish into the Russian prison system.) Bout is a Russian arms dealer, a major-league bad guy whose nickname is “the Merchant of Death.” He’s been in American custody since 2010, and is now doing time at Marion penitentiary
        in Illinois for providing weapons to international terrorists and conspiring with them to kill Americans. “I’ll get back to Russia,” Bout told a reporter in 2014. “I don’t know when. But I’m still young. Your empire will collapse and I’ll get
        out of here.”
