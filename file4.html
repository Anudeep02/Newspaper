        Donald Trump is back in Washington Tuesday for the first time since leaving in disgrace 18 months ago and his speech to a right-wing think tank will shed light on whether the Republican is serious about trying to return -- as president.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Since taking his last Air Force One flight from Washington to Florida on January 20 last year, Trump has remained the country's most polarizing figure, continuing his unprecedented campaign to sow doubts about his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.

    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        For weeks, Washington has been riveted by hearings in Congress on the January 6, 2021, riot by a Trump mob and the defeated president's attempts to overturn the election.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        With Biden's approval rating currently below 40 percent and Democrats forecasted to lose control of Congress in November midterm elections, Trump is apparently bullish that he could ride the Republican wave all the way to the White House in 2024.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        An announcement is not expected during his speech to the America First Policy Institute, a think tank run by allies.
        <p style="font-size: 30px">
            But the timing of the Washington appearance and the symbolism of the setting reflect Trump's growing confidence that he has survived the fallout from his supporters' assault on Congress, emerging with his standing as the biggest name in Republican politics
            intact.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 30px">
            A spokesman, Taylor Budowich, said Trump, 76, would look forward. "President Trump sees a nation in decline that is driven, in part, by rising crime and communities becoming less safe under Democrat policies," Budowich said in a statement.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px">
            "His remarks will highlight the policy failures of Democrats, while laying out an America First vision for public safety that will surely be a defining issue during the midterms and beyond."
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px">
            Attack on democracy - That Trump is headlining a high-profile Republican event in the US capital, let alone mulling an attempt to recapture the White House in two years, is remarkable.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px">
            In the hours after the January 6 riot, even some of his most senior boosters in Congress publicly disowned him.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px">
            But a year and a half later, despite an ever-darkening picture of his attempts to undermine the election, just a handful of Republican lawmakers dare oppose Trump, while the party's most active fringe embraces his election conspiracy theories.
