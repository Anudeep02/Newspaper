                    A Russian court on Thursday sentenced the American basketball star Brittney Griner to nine years in a penal colony after convicting her on a drug charge, a harsh penalty that keeps her fate entwined with the geopolitical showdown over the war in Ukraine
                    and ramps up already intense pressure on President Biden to win her release.</p>

                    The U.S. government contends that she is among several Americans who have been “wrongfully detained” by Russia, used as bargaining chips in the increasingly hostile relationship between Moscow and Washington.The Biden administration has offered a prisoner
                    swap involving Ms. Griner, but Russian officials said it was premature to discuss a deal while her case was underway.

                    The Kremlin, for its part, can use them as leverage, with no incentive to resolve the cases quickly. Her supporters, voicing horror at the verdict and sentence, are clamoring for the president to do something, while the administration is wary of giving

                    A day after Nancy Pelosi’s trip, China has begun military drills near Taiwan. They appear to be designed as a trial run for sealing off the island. Five missiles landed in Japanese waters.

                    At least 11 Chinese missiles struck seas north, south and east of Taiwan on Thursday, less than 24 hours after Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrated the island as a bulwark of democracy next to autocratic China. The People’s Liberation Army declared its missiles
                    “all precisely hit their targets,” even as Japan said five landed in its waters

                    Another missile, the government said, landed 50 miles northwest of Yonaguni, a small island at Japan’s southernmost tip and just a short distance from Taiwan; the missile did not land in Japan’s economic zone.

                <p>
                    Donald Trump is back in Washington Tuesday for the first time since leaving in disgrace 18 months ago and his speech to a right-wing think tank will shed light on whether the Republican is serious about trying to return -- as president.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since taking his last Air Force One flight from Washington to Florida on January 20 last year, Trump has remained the country's most polarizing figure, continuing his unprecedented campaign to sow doubts about his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For weeks, Washington has been riveted by hearings in Congress on the January 6, 2021, riot by a Trump mob and the defeated president's attempts to overturn the election.

                    Artillery duels around a huge power plant on the Dnipro river raised the risk of an accident, as each side blamed the other for the explosions on Friday. The top Russian and U.S. diplomats said they were ready to discuss a deal to secure the release of

                    DRUZHKIVKA, Ukraine — Ukrainian officials have been raising alarms for months. The world’s nuclear watchdog agency warned of the extraordinary risks just this week.

                <p>
                    Nearly two dozen Republican state treasurers around the country are working to thwart climate action on state and federal levels, fighting regulations that would make clear the economic risks posed by a warming world, lobbying against climate-minded nominees
                    to key federal posts and using the tax dollars they control to punish companies that want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past year, treasurers in nearly half the United States have been coordinating tactics and talking points, meeting in private and cheering one another in public as part of a well-funded campaign to protect the fossil fuel companies that bolster
                    their local economies.
