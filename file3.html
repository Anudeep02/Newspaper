        Artillery duels around a huge power plant on the Dnipro river raised the risk of an accident, as each side blamed the other for the explosions on Friday. The top Russian and U.S. diplomats said they were ready to discuss a deal to secure the release of
        the American basketball star Brittney Griner.

        DRUZHKIVKA, Ukraine — Ukrainian officials have been raising alarms for months. The world’s nuclear watchdog agency warned of the extraordinary risks just this week. Then on Friday, artillery duels near a giant nuclear power plant on the Dnipro River in
        southern Ukraine created new safety risks.

        Explosions in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power complex at about 2:30 p.m. destroyed electrical transmission lines and posed risks of damaging the plant, forcing engineers to alter the operation of one of its six reactors by reducing power, Ukraine’s
        state nuclear company, Energoatom, said.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Hours later, a second series of three explosions damaged an auxiliary building near one of the nuclear reactors, raising the risk of hydrogen leaks and fire, the company said.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the attacks.

    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        “This is the largest nuclear power plant on our continent, and any shelling of this facility is an open, brazen crime, an act of terror,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address. “Russia should bear responsibility for the very fact of
        creating a threat to the nuclear power plant.”
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        The Russian ministry of defense said it was Ukrainian forces who had shelled the plant, accusing them of an act of “nuclear terrorism.”
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        No radiation was released after the first explosions, the state nuclear company said. But the forced change in the reactor’s operation underscored the rising danger.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        Fighting has intensified in recent weeks near the nuclear complex, which the Russian military controls and is using as a fortress, even as Ukrainian engineers continue to operate it.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">
        For about a month, Russia has used the site to stage artillery strikes on Ukrainian targets without fear of retaliation, since the Ukrainian military cannot fire back without risk of hitting safety equipment, reactors or storage facilities for spent fuel.
        Ukrainian officials say the Russians aim to disrupt a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the country’s south.
